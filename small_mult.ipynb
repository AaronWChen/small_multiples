    "# Small Multiples\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Created by Cristian E. Nuno\n",

    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Small multiples is a visualization technique that partions your data such that you're visualizing one piece of it at a time. These pieces are stored as series of individual plots (i.e. subplots) that share the same x and y-axes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having each subplot on the same scale makes it easier for the reader to compare one subplot to the next without having to mentally account for different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "For you to be able to create small multiples in python using [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/subplots_demo.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial was inspired by Yan Holtz's [_Small Multiples for Line Charts_](https://python-graph-gallery.com/125-small-multiples-for-line-chart/) tutorial. \n"
